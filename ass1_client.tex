\begin{abstract}
    In this report, we propose a solution to optimise your supply chain logistics, 
    to minimise costs while ensuring all demands are met.
\end{abstract}

\part{Solution}
We have considered your requirements of weekly demand, DC capacity, northside capacity and surge demands.
We propose
the following assignment of stores to distribution centres.\\[0.8em]
\begin{tabular}{l  r  r  r }
    Store & DC0 & DC1 & DC2 \\ 
S0 & 0.00\% & 0.00\% & 100.00\% \\
S1 & 100.00\% & 0.00\% & 0.00\% \\
S2 & 100.00\% & 0.00\% & 0.00\% \\
S3 & 0.00\% & 100.00\% & 0.00\% \\
S4 & 58.82\% & 0.00\% & 41.18\% \\
S5 & 0.00\% & 83.86\% & 16.14\% \\
S6 & 0.00\% & 100.00\% & 0.00\% \\
S7 & 0.00\% & 64.77\% & 35.23\% \\
S8 & 0.00\% & 64.77\% & 35.23\% \\
S9 & 100.00\% & 0.00\% & 0.00\% \\ 
\end{tabular}\\[0.8em]
We have verified that these assignments can scale up to the surge scenarios provided
without exceeding and of your capacity limits.

\section{Costs}
Under normal demand, this would cost you \$199661.44 per week. This was the cost 
that was minimised.
The costs for each surge scenario are outlined below.\\[0.8em]
\begin{tabular}{r  r }
Scenario & Cost  \\ 
0 & \$227409.44 \\ 
1& \$246009.15\\
2 &\$200468.44 \\ 
3 &\$251438.63\\
4 &\$305536.20 \\
\end{tabular}\\[0.8em]

\part{Impact of Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only considering each store's demand without any capacity constraints 
(communication 1) resulted in a cost of \$150212.

\item With DC capacity (communication 2) was considered, the cost was  \$174952.

\item With the northside capacity limit (communication 3) as well, the cost was \$179882.

\item Catering to the surge scenarios results in the cost discussed above.
\end{itemize}

\part{Additional Notes}
While optimising the assignments with the data you provided us, we made 
the following observations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item With the exception of surge scenario 4, the capacity at DC1 is never 
fully used. Normal demand and scenarios 0--3 use at most 54 truckloads per week 
from DC1. However, reducing its throughput (by any amount) would make surge scenario 4
impossible.
    \item DC0's capacity of 72 is never fully utilised. At most, 45.6 truckloads are 
    required from it per week (during scenario 4).
    \item Surge scenario 4 is the limit of your current system. It requires 161 truckloads 
    in total. Because DC0 and DC2 together can only supply 85 and DC1 can supply 76, this is 
    exactly 161 truckloads per week. 
\end{itemize}
